My first passion in life was art. I explored this through drawing and painting, but I never wanted to be an artist, I wanted to be a part of something bigger. After my first year of college and a few acts of serendipity I landed on Software Engineering with a minor in Art & Design focusing mainly on Graphic Design. I was attracted to idea of creating something for a user to enjoy. Something visually striking, navigable, and effective. This led me to explore front-end development and the user-experience.
